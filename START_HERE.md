# 🎮 Base Runner - Your Game is Ready!

## 🎉 What You Have Now

I've transformed your Vercel mini app template into a **fully functional endless runner game** called **Base Runner** with complete Web3 integration!

## 📁 Key Files

### Game Files

### Smart Contract
- `contracts/BaseRunner.sol` - Full Solidity contract with:
  - Score tracking and leaderboard
  - Energy system (3 plays per day)
  - Player statistics
  - Events and proper access control

### Documentation
- `BUILD_SUMMARY.md` - Complete overview of what was built
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture diagrams
- `ENVIRONMENT.md` - Environment setup instructions
- `CHECKLIST.md` - Deployment checklist

## 📋 Next Steps

### Option 1: Deploy Now (Without Contract)
The game works perfectly without a smart contract using localStorage:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Configure Farcaster account association
4. Publish to Base app

**You're done!** The game is fully playable.

### Option 2: Add Blockchain Features
To enable the onchain leaderboard and energy system:

1. Deploy `contracts/BaseRunner.sol` to Base Sepolia
2. Add contract address to environment variables
3. Redeploy to Vercel

Now scores are stored onchain!
